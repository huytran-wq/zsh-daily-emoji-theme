# zsh-daily-emoji-theme

A ZSH custom theme that shows random emojis at the beginning of each command depending on the day of the week. I'm not sure who wrote the initial version of this theme. I modified it so that the prompt shows the information that I want.

## Setup steps:
1. Create a custom theme in `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes` with format `<my-theme-name>.zsh-theme`
2. Paste this theme content to the newly created theme
3. Specify the custom theme name in `~/.zshrc` for the variable `ZSH_THEME`
4. Open a new terminal instance to apply the theme
